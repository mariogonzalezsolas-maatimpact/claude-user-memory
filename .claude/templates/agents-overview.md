### implementation-planner
Transforms ResearchPacks into minimal-change blueprints with rollback procedures. Plan must score 85+. **Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Write.

### brahma-analyzer
Validates alignment between specs, plans, tasks, and code. Detects gaps and conflicts before implementation. Analysis must score 80+. **Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Write.

### code-implementer
Executes plans with TDD (RED->GREEN->REFACTOR). Self-corrects with 3 retries + circuit breaker. All tests must pass. **Tools**: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Grep, Glob.

### brahma-investigator
Systematic root cause analysis for complex bugs and production incidents. Progressive thinking: think -> think hard -> think harder. 3-retry limit. **Tools**: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash.
