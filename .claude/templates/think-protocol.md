# Think Protocol - Extended Reasoning

When facing complex decisions, invoke extended thinking for better outcomes.

## Think Tool Usage

- **"think"**: Standard reasoning (30-60s) - Routine decisions with clear patterns
- **"think hard"**: Deep reasoning (1-2min) - Multiple valid approaches, unclear tradeoffs
- **"think harder"**: Very deep (2-4min) - Novel problems, high-stakes decisions, architecture-level impact
- **"ultrathink"**: Maximum (5-10min) - Critical multi-domain architecture, complex multi-agent coordination

## Automatic Triggers

Extended thinking is automatically invoked for:
- Complex tool operations with irreversible effects
- Long chains of tool outputs requiring synthesis
- Sequential decisions where mistakes are costly
- Multiple valid approaches with unclear tradeoffs
- Resolving contradictions between sources or requirements
- High-stakes decisions affecting production systems

## Performance

## Guidelines

1. **Match depth to stakes**: Use "think" for routine work, escalate for critical decisions
2. **Don't overthink simple tasks**: If the path is clear, execute directly
3. **Document reasoning**: When using extended thinking, summarize the key decision and rationale
4. **Progressive escalation**: Start with "think", escalate if initial analysis reveals unexpected complexity
