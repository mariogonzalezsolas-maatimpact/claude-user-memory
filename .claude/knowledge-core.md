## Architectural Principles

### Principle 1: Agentic Substrate Philosophy
**Established**: 2025-10-18

The Agentic Substrate is the **foundational layer that agents build upon** to achieve superintelligent capabilities:

- **Agent autonomy first**: Minimal scaffolding, maximum model control (Anthropic pattern)
- **Context engineering as first-class discipline**: What goes into context matters more than prompt wording
- **Think before act**: Extended thinking for complex decisions (54% improvement)
- **Economic viability**: Multi-agent costs 15x tokens, requires 15x+ value
- **Truth over speed**: Achieve both through systematic approach
- **Synthesis over imitation**: Integrate best patterns from multiple sources (Philia Sophia)

### Principle 2: Research -> Plan -> Implement Workflow
**Established**: 2024-07-30 (Enhanced 2025-10-18, Pyramid added 2026-03-25)

All development follows strict workflow:
1. **Research Phase**: Gather authoritative, version-accurate documentation (docs-researcher)
2. **Planning Phase**: Create minimal-change, reversible implementation plans (plan-coordinator / implementation-planner)
3. **Implementation Phase**: Execute with TDD and self-correction (code-coordinator / code-implementer)
4. **Review Phase** (v7.2): Code review + browser testing with fix loop (review-coordinator)

**Quality Gates**: Each phase has validation before proceeding. Review gate triggers fix loop (max 3 iterations).

### Principle 3: Minimal Changes, Maximum Safety
**Established**: 2024-07-31

Every change must be: **Surgical** (fewest files), **Reversible** (include rollback), **Incremental** (independently valuable), **Tested** (TDD mandatory), **Documented** (git commits with co-author attribution).

### Principle 4: Memory Hierarchy and Import Syntax
**Established**: 2025-10-18

7-level memory hierarchy: Managed Policy > Project > Project Rules > User > Project Local > Imports (@path, max 5 hops) > Auto Memory.

### Principle 5: Quality Over Speed (But Achieve Both)
**Established**: 2025-10-18

Never sacrifice quality for performance. Use systematic approach to achieve both. Real-world validation over synthetic benchmarks.

### Principle 6: 28-Agent Architecture with Pyramid Orchestration
**Established**: 2025-10-18 (Expanded: 9→15 in v5.2, 15→25 in v7.0, 25→28 in v7.2)

The complete agent system with 28 specialized agents organized in 5 tiers + pyramid coordinators:

## Established Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pyramid Orchestration (v7.2)

**Context**: All code-producing tasks need planning, coding, and review
**Problem**: Sequential single-agent execution misses bugs, lacks review discipline
**Established**: 2026-03-25

**Solution**: 3-tier pyramid with automatic fix loop

```
Tier 1: Orchestrator (main thread) -- classifies, dispatches, synthesizes
Tier 2: plan-coordinator -> code-coordinator -> review-coordinator
Tier 3: Coordinators handle specialties internally
```

**Loop**: Plan -> Code -> Review -> Fix (max 3 iterations). Review FAIL triggers plan-coordinator re-plan.

**Key Constraint**: Sub-agents cannot spawn other sub-agents. Orchestrator manages all dispatching.

**Cost**: 3 agent calls (happy path), 6 (1 fix loop), 9 (max fix loops)

**Files**: `.claude/agents/plan-coordinator.md`, `.claude/agents/code-coordinator.md`, `.claude/agents/review-coordinator.md`, `.claude/skills/pyramid-loop/skill.md`, `.claude/templates/pyramid-orchestration.md`

---

### Pattern 2: Think Tool Protocol for Complex Decisions

**Established**: 2025-10-18

Extended thinking modes for progressively deeper reasoning:
- **"think"** (30-60s): Routine decisions
- **"think hard"** (1-2min): Multiple valid approaches
- **"think harder"** (2-4min): Novel problems, high-stakes
- **"ultrathink"** (5-10min): Critical architecture, multi-agent coordination

**Performance**: 54% improvement on complex tasks (Anthropic research)

**Files**: `.claude/templates/think-protocol.md`, all 28 agents include Think Protocol section

---

### Pattern 3: Context Engineering and Active Curation

**Established**: 2025-10-18

Active context curation as first-class discipline. Triggers: >50 messages, task switch, before complex ops, after major learnings.

**Performance**: 39% improvement, 84% token reduction

**Files**: `.claude/skills/context-engineering/skill.md`, `.claude/commands/context.md`

---

### Pattern 4: Multi-Agent Parallel Spawning with Economic Viability Gates

**Established**: 2025-10-18

Lead agent spawns 3-5 subagents in parallel. Economic viability check mandatory (15x cost).

**Performance**: 90.2% performance gain, up to 90% time reduction

**Files**: `.claude/agents/chief-architect.md`, `.claude/hooks/check-agent-economics.sh`

---

### Pattern 5: TDD Enforcement (Mandatory)

**Established**: 2025-10-18

Red -> Green -> Refactor cycle. Cycle time: 6-10 min per feature unit. Tests must be written BEFORE implementation. All tests must pass before commit.

**Files**: `.claude/agents/code-implementer.md`, `.claude/agents/code-coordinator.md`

---

### Pattern 6: Git Automation with Co-Author Attribution

**Established**: 2025-10-18

Automated git operations. Co-author: `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`. Only commit if tests pass. Never commit secrets.

---

### Pattern 7: Multi-Modal Quality Validation

**Established**: 2025-10-18

Research type detection with specialized scoring rubrics:
- API/Library Research: 80+ pass threshold
- Philosophy Research: 70+ pass threshold
- Pattern Research: 75+ pass threshold
- Methodology Research: 75+ pass threshold

**Files**: `.claude/skills/quality-validation/skill.md`

---

### Pattern 8: Error Self-Learning (v7.1)

**Established**: 2026-03-10

Auto-captures errors to `memory/errors.md`. 6 categories. Pattern detection: 3+ similar errors escalate to prevention rules.

**Files**: `.claude/skills/error-learning/skill.md`, `.claude/hooks/auto-error-capture.sh`

---

### Pattern 9: Hawk Oversight (v7.1)

**Established**: 2026-03-10

Real-time PostToolUse hook detecting chaotic oscillation, reward hacking, destructive ops, error swallowing.

**Files**: `.claude/hooks/hawk.sh`, `.claude/templates/hawk-pattern.md`

---

### Pattern 10: Anti-Reward-Hacking Rules (v7.1)

**Established**: 2026-03-10

Prevents: test.skip abuse, generic error swallowing, mock abuse, force-installing, evidence deletion.

**Files**: `.claude/rules/anti-reward-hacking.md`

---

### Pattern 11: Linked Chunks (v7.1)

**Established**: 2026-03-10

`@linked` references create explicit dependency graphs. Read all linked files before editing. Update linked docs if behavior changes.

**Files**: `.claude/rules/linked-chunks.md`

---

### Pattern 12: Agent Report Protocol (v7.0, enhanced v7.2)

**Established**: 2026-02-27 (Pyramid-aware v1.2: 2026-03-25)

Compact report format (<800 tokens) for all agents. Pyramid coordinators use specialized formats (<500 tokens each). Lead processes ~1500 tokens per iteration.

**Files**: `.claude/templates/AGENT-REPORT-PROTOCOL.md`

---

### Pattern 13: Memory Hierarchy and Modular Organization

**Established**: 2025-10-18

Import syntax (`@path/to/file.md`, max 5 hops) for modular CLAUDE.md organization. Prevents bloat, enables team + individual preferences.

---

### Pattern 14: Contextual Retrieval for Research

**Established**: 2025-10-18

Prepend chunk-specific explanatory context before embedding/indexing.

**Performance**: 49% reduction in failed retrievals (standalone), 67% with reranking

---

## Key Decisions & Learnings

### (2026-03-25) Pyramid Orchestration as Default Execution Model

**Decision**: All code-producing `/do` routes use 3-tier pyramid by default (plan -> code -> review -> fix loop)

**Rationale**: Catches bugs before production, prevents repeated user back-and-forth, browser testing catches UI issues that code review misses

**Impact**: 3 new agents (plan-coordinator, code-coordinator, review-coordinator), 1 new skill (pyramid-loop), agents 25→28, skills 10→11

---

### (2026-03-10) Error Self-Tracking and Hawk Oversight

**Decision**: Auto-capture errors, detect anti-patterns in real-time

**Impact**: 4 new hooks (auto-error-capture, hawk, session-start update, Stop hook), 1 new skill (error-learning), 3 new rules, 3 new templates

---

### (2026-02-27) 10 New Engineering + Quality Agents

**Decision**: Expand from 15 to 25 agents with Engineering tier (5 agents) + expanded Infrastructure and Quality tiers

**Impact**: 9 new commands, 4 new skills, Agent Report Protocol standardized

---

### (2025-10-25) Adaptive Learning Integration

**Decision**: Hybrid architecture for pattern learning (human-readable knowledge-core.md + machine-readable pattern-index.json)

**Bayesian Confidence**: `confidence = base_confidence x time_decay x evidence_factor`

**Expected**: 30-40% faster implementations on 5th+ similar feature

---

### (2025-10-18) "Agentic Substrate" as Project Identity

**Decision**: Adopt "Agentic Substrate" term. Repository stays `claude-user-memory` for SEO, README uses "Agentic Substrate"

**Tagline**: "The foundational layer for Claude Code superintelligence"

---

### (2025-10-18) Philia Sophia Synthesis Approach

**Decision**: Synthesize Anthropic + VAMFI patterns (not imitate, integrate)

From Anthropic: agent autonomy, context engineering, think-before-act, multi-agent economics, truth over speed
From VAMFI: Brahma orchestration, autonomous operation, quality gates, knowledge preservation, surgical changes, self-correction, circuit breaker

---

### Anti-Pattern: Documentation-Implementation Mismatch

**Identified**: 2025-11-06 | **Severity**: CRITICAL

Documentation must match reality. Automated validation (agent count matches files). Regular reviews with each major version. Score of 32/100 is unacceptable -- must be 90+.

**Fixed**: Ongoing enforcement via version bumps and CHANGELOG

---

### Anti-Pattern: Soft Quality Gates Pretending to be Hard

**Identified**: 2025-11-06

Quality gates must use `exit 1` (not `exit 0` with warnings). Add `--force` override for prototyping. Clear error messages.
