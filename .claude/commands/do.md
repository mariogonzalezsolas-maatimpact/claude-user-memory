# /do Command

**The Universal Command** - Just say what you want, and I'll figure out how to do it.

## Usage

```bash
/do [anything you want]
```

## First Use in Session - Automatic Context Gathering

**On first `/do` of the session**, automatically gather project context:

### Step 0: Context Discovery (First Use Only)

**Execute these searches in parallel**:

1. **Find project CLAUDE.md**:
   ```
   Look for: ./CLAUDE.md, ./.claude/CLAUDE.md, ./docs/CLAUDE.md
   ```

2. **Find key documentation**:
   ```
   Glob: **/*.md (limit to first 20)
   Priority: README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/*.md
   ```

3. **Detect project type**:
   ```
   Look for: package.json, Cargo.toml, go.mod, requirements.txt, pom.xml
   Extract: project name, version, main dependencies
   ```

4. **Find existing context artifacts**:
   ```
   Look for: ResearchPack*.md, ImplementationPlan*.md, knowledge-core.md
   In: ./, ./.claude/, ./docs/
   ```

5. **Check circuit breaker state**:
   ```
   Read: ~/.claude/.circuit-breaker-state
   ```

**Report context summary**:
```
📍 Project Context Loaded
   Project: [name from package.json or directory]
   Type: [Node.js/Python/Rust/Go/etc]
   CLAUDE.md: [Found/Not found]
   Existing artifacts: [ResearchPack, Plan, etc. or None]
   Circuit breaker: [CLOSED/OPEN]

Ready to help. What do you need?
```

**Then proceed to intent classification.**

## Examples

```bash
/do add authentication to my API
/do why is this function slow?
/do research how to use Redis
/do check if my context is getting too large
/do deploy to production
/do fix the bug in login.js
/do explain this codebase
```

## How It Works

I analyze your request and automatically route to the best approach:

| Your Intent | I Execute |
|-------------|-----------|
| Build/Add/Create feature | `/workflow` (full automation) |
| Research/Learn/Understand | `/research` + summary |
| Plan/Design/Architect | `/plan` (create blueprint) |
| Implement/Code/Fix (with plan) | `/implement` |

| Business analysis/Requirements | `@business-analyst` |
| Content/Marketing/Blog/Social | `@content-strategist` |
| Product strategy/Roadmap/Market | `@product-strategist` |
| Security audit/Vulnerabilities | `@security-auditor` |
| UX review/Accessibility/WCAG | `@ux-accessibility-reviewer` |
| Context/Memory issues | `/context analyze` |
| Complex multi-domain | `@chief-architect` |
| Complex parallel work (3+ layers) | Agent Team (with confirmation) |
| Simple question | Direct answer |

### Step 1.5: Agent Teams Escalation Check

**BEFORE executing**, evaluate whether the task would benefit from parallel Agent Teams teammates instead of sequential sub-agents.

#### Escalate to Agent Team if ANY of these are true:

**Multi-layer signals** (task touches 3+ distinct layers):
- Frontend + Backend + Database mentioned
- API + UI + Tests mentioned
- "full-stack", "end-to-end", "cross-layer", "complete system"
- Example: "add Stripe payment integration" → DB + backend + frontend + tests

**Explicit parallel request**:
- "en paralelo", "in parallel", "simultaneously", "agent team", "team", "teammates"
- Example: "review this PR with a team"

**Multi-angle audit/review**:
- "full audit", "complete review", "comprehensive audit"
- Security + performance + coverage angles
- Example: "full security audit of the codebase"

**Large refactor signals**:
- "refactor", "migrate", "rewrite" + mentions 5+ files or multiple directories
- "across all modules", "every service", "entire codebase"
- Example: "refactor auth across all microservices"

#### Keep sub-agents (default) if ANY of these are true:
- Task is single-domain (only backend, only frontend, only research)
- User says "quick", "rapido", "simple", "fast"
- Task is research-only, plan-only, or single-file fix
- Task matches a specific agent category (SEO, security, etc.) without multi-layer scope

#### When escalating, propose (never auto-spawn):

Show the user:
```
🚀 Agent Teams Recommendation
   This task touches [X layers]: [list layers detected]
   Recommended team: [N] teammates

   1. [Role 1]: [scope]
   2. [Role 2]: [scope]
   3. [Role 3]: [scope]

   Template: [Code Review Team / Feature Build Team / Debug Team]

   Proceed with Agent Team? Or prefer sequential sub-agents?
```

**If user confirms** → Use the matching template from agent-teams.md to brief teammates
**If user declines** → Continue with normal sub-agent routing (Step 2)

### Step 2: Execute Decision

Based on classification, announce what you're doing:

```
🎯 Intent detected: [CATEGORY]
📋 Executing: [COMMAND/AGENT]
💡 Reason: [WHY THIS CHOICE]

---
[Execute the chosen command/agent]
```

### Step 3: Fallback Logic

If intent is unclear:
1. Ask ONE clarifying question with options
2. Default to `/workflow` for feature requests
3. Default to `@brahma-investigator` for problems/issues
4. Default to `/research` for questions

### Step 4: Smart Enhancements

**Auto-detect complexity**:
- Simple task (1-2 files) → Direct implementation
- Medium task (3-5 files) → `/workflow`
- Complex task (6+ files, multiple domains) → `@chief-architect`

**Auto-detect urgency**:
- "urgent", "asap", "quick" → Skip extensive research, focus on solution
- "careful", "safe", "production" → Full workflow with all quality gates

**Auto-detect existing context**:
- ResearchPack exists → Skip to `/plan`
- Plan exists → Skip to `/implement`
- Nothing exists → Start with `/research` or `/workflow`

## Examples with Routing

**User**: `/do add user authentication`
```
🎯 Intent: BUILD FEATURE
📋 Executing: /workflow add user authentication
💡 Reason: "add" + "authentication" = new feature requiring research, planning, and implementation
```

**User**: `/do why is my API slow?`
```
🎯 Intent: DEBUG/INVESTIGATE
📋 Executing: @brahma-investigator analyze API performance issue
💡 Reason: "why" + "slow" = performance investigation needed
```

**User**: `/do learn about WebSockets`
```
🎯 Intent: RESEARCH
📋 Executing: /research WebSockets
💡 Reason: "learn about" = research request, no implementation needed
```

**User**: `/do my context is huge`
```
🎯 Intent: CONTEXT MANAGEMENT
📋 Executing: /context analyze
💡 Reason: "context" + size concern = context optimization needed
```

**User**: `/do deploy the new version`
```
🎯 Intent: DEPLOYMENT
📋 Executing: @brahma-deployer
💡 Reason: "deploy" = production deployment workflow
```

**User**: `/do improve our SEO rankings`
```
🎯 Intent: SEO
📋 Executing: @seo-strategist
💡 Reason: "SEO" + "rankings" = search engine optimization audit needed
```

**User**: `/do analyze our customer journey`
```
🎯 Intent: BUSINESS ANALYSIS
📋 Executing: @business-analyst
💡 Reason: "analyze" + "customer journey" = business process analysis
```

**User**: `/do create blog content for launch`
```
🎯 Intent: CONTENT/MARKETING
📋 Executing: @content-strategist
💡 Reason: "blog content" + "launch" = content marketing strategy
```

**User**: `/do evaluate market opportunity`
```
🎯 Intent: PRODUCT STRATEGY
📋 Executing: @product-strategist
💡 Reason: "market opportunity" = market analysis and product strategy
```

**User**: `/do security check before deploy`
```
🎯 Intent: SECURITY
📋 Executing: @security-auditor
💡 Reason: "security check" + "deploy" = pre-deployment security audit
```

**User**: `/do check accessibility compliance`
```
🎯 Intent: UX/ACCESSIBILITY
📋 Executing: @ux-accessibility-reviewer
💡 Reason: "accessibility compliance" = WCAG audit and UX review
```

**User**: `/do add Stripe payment integration`
```
🎯 Intent: BUILD FEATURE (multi-layer)
🚀 Agent Teams Recommendation:
   This task touches 4 layers: DB + backend + frontend + tests
   Recommended: Feature Build Team (3 teammates)
   Proceed with Agent Team? Or prefer sequential sub-agents?
```

**User**: `/do full security audit of the codebase`
```
🎯 Intent: SECURITY AUDIT (multi-angle)
🚀 Agent Teams Recommendation:
   Multi-angle audit detected: security + performance + test coverage
   Recommended: Code Review Team (3 teammates)
   Proceed with Agent Team? Or prefer sequential sub-agents?
```

**User**: `/do fix the bug in auth middleware`
```
🎯 Intent: DEBUG/INVESTIGATE
📋 Executing: @brahma-investigator
💡 Reason: Focused single-module task → sub-agents (no escalation)
```

**User**: `/do research Redis caching best practices`
```
🎯 Intent: RESEARCH
📋 Executing: /research Redis caching
💡 Reason: Research-only → sub-agents (no escalation)
```

## Context Awareness Throughout Session

### Continuous Context Monitoring

Every `/do` command checks:
- **Existing ResearchPack** → Can skip research phase
- **Existing Plan** → Can skip planning phase
- **Recent errors** → May need investigation first
- **Circuit breaker state** → May be blocked
- **Session history** → What we already discussed

### Smart Continuation

If you say `/do continue` or `/do next`:
- Looks at what was done before
- Continues from where we left off
- Example: Research done → Proceeds to Plan

### Context Commands

```bash
/do what's the context?     → Shows current project state
/do clean up context        → Runs /context optimize
/do start fresh             → Runs /context reset
/do what did we do?         → Summarizes session actions
```

## Benefits

- **No need to memorize commands** - Just say what you want
- **Intelligent routing** - I pick the best tool for the job
- **Context aware** - I check what's already done
- **Auto-discovery** - Finds CLAUDE.md, docs, and artifacts
- **Complexity detection** - Simple tasks stay simple
- **Session memory** - Remembers what we've done
- **One entry point** - `/do` handles everything
