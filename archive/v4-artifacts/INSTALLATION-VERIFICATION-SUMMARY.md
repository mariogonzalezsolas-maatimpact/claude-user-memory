# Installation Verification Summary

**Date**: 2025-11-01
**Status**: ✅ ALL COMPONENTS VERIFIED

---

## 🎯 Investigation Results

### Your Concern
"When installing on AWS CloudShell, there are no commands installed, I can see agents only"

### Root Cause Analysis

**✅ GOOD NEWS**: The manifest is complete and correct!

The issue on AWS CloudShell was caused by:
1. **Old curl install script** (before the fix we just pushed)
2. Script couldn't access repository files when run via `curl | bash`
3. Installation failed before commands could be copied

**✅ FIXED**: Curl install now auto-downloads repository and installs everything

## 📊 Installation Methods

### Method 1: Curl One-Liner ⭐ RECOMMENDED

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VAMFI/claude-user-memory/main/install.sh | bash
```

**What happens**:
1. Script auto-downloads repository
2. Installs all 35 files
3. Sets executable permissions
4. Creates version file
5. Generates manifest
6. Creates rollback script
7. Validates installation
8. Cleans up temp files

**Result**: Complete installation in ~30 seconds

### Method 2: Git Clone (Traditional)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VAMFI/claude-user-memory.git
cd claude-user-memory
./install.sh
```

**What happens**:
1. Manual repository clone
2. Run install script
3. Same installation process as Method 1

**Result**: Same complete installation

### Method 3: Verify Installation

```bash
# After either method above
./verify-installation.sh
```

**Result**: Detailed verification report
