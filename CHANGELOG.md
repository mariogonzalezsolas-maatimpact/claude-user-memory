  - Tier 4: Growth & Strategy / GROW (6 agents) - SEO, business, content, product, security, UX

### Performance
- All Tier 4 agents include Think Protocol integration
- DeepWiki MCP mandatory for all new agents
- Quality scoring systems: SEO Score (0-100), Security Score (0-100), UX+A11y Score (0-100)
- Anti-stagnation measures with time limits and progress reporting

## [3.1.0] - 2025-10-25

### Added

#### Adaptive Learning System (Adaptation Pattern from Chapter 9)
- **3-Phase Learning Loop**: Before (suggest patterns) → During (track metrics) → After (update confidence)
- **Bayesian Confidence Scoring**: `confidence = base_confidence × time_decay_factor × evidence_factor`
  - Base confidence from success rate (successes / total_uses)
  - Time decay factor: 1.0 (<90 days), 0.75 (90-180 days), 0.5 (180+ days)
  - Evidence factor: 0.5 (<3 uses), 0.75 (3-4 uses), 1.0 (5+ uses)
- **Confidence Levels**: HIGH (≥80%), MEDIUM (50-79%), LOW (<50%)
- **Context-Aware Pattern Matching**: ≥60% tag similarity required
- **Hybrid Architecture**:
  - Human-readable: `knowledge-core.md` (existing patterns)
  - Machine-readable: `~/.claude/data/pattern-index.json` (metrics and confidence)

#### New Files
- `~/.claude/data/pattern-index.json` - Pattern metrics storage (9 patterns migrated)
- `~/.claude/scripts/calculate-confidence.sh` - Standalone Bayesian confidence calculator
- `~/.claude/scripts/validate-pattern-index.sh` - JSON validation script
- `.vamfi/tests/test_adaptation_pattern.sh` - Comprehensive test suite (12 tests)

#### Enhanced Agents
- **chief-architect.md**: Added Phase 3.5 pattern suggestion workflow (+103 lines)
  - Suggests proven patterns before implementation
  - Allows user acceptance/rejection
  - Passes pattern context to code-implementer
- **code-implementer.md**: Added metrics tracking capabilities (+63 lines)
  - Captures implementation start time
  - Tracks retry attempts during self-correction
  - Records success/failure and quality gates
  - Passes metrics to pattern-recognition skill for learning

#### Enhanced Skills
- **pattern-recognition/skill.md**: Transformed from passive to adaptive (+391 lines)
  - Phase 1: Pattern suggestion before implementation
  - Phase 2: Context extraction and similarity matching
  - Phase 3: Metrics capture during implementation
  - Phase 4: Confidence update after completion
  - Graceful degradation when pattern-index.json missing

### Changed
- **Version**: Bumped from 3.0.0 to 3.1.0
- **README.md**: Added "Adaptive Learning (NEW v3.1)" section with:
  - 3-phase workflow visualization
  - Performance impact metrics (30-40% faster on 5th+ similar feature)
  - Key features and example usage
- **pattern-recognition skill**: Now version 3.1 with adaptive capabilities
- **chief-architect agent**: Now version 1.1 with pattern suggestion
- **code-implementer agent**: Now version 2.1 with metrics tracking

### Performance Impact
- **Expected Improvements**:
  - 30-40% faster implementations on 5th+ similar feature
  - 80%+ pattern suggestion accuracy
  - 70%+ user acceptance rate
  - Zero breaking changes (100% backward compatible)

### Testing
- **Automated Tests**: 12 tests, all passing
  - 6 automated (confidence calculation, JSON validation, schema, degradation)
  - 6 file existence checks
  - 4 manual tests documented
- **Coverage**: Pattern suggestion, metrics tracking, confidence calculation, graceful degradation
- **Platform**: Verified on macOS (Darwin 25.0.0)

### Documentation
- **ResearchPack**: 888 lines, score 100/100
  - Complete analysis of Adaptation Pattern from Chapter 9
  - Hybrid architecture design
  - Integration strategy with existing patterns
- **Implementation Plan**: 1,900 lines, score 100/100
  - 9-step surgical implementation
  - Rollback procedures for each step
  - Testing strategy and validation criteria

### Migration Notes
- **Backward Compatible**: All existing workflows continue working unchanged
- **Graceful Degradation**: System functions normally without pattern-index.json
- **Migration**: 9 existing patterns automatically migrated to pattern-index.json with conservative defaults
- **Safe Rollback**: Feature branch used for easy rollback if needed
